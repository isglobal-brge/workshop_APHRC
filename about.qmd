## Overview

The DataSHIELD + OMOP CDM Workshop is a specialized training program designed to bridge the gap between advanced health data technologies and their practical application in African health research contexts. This workshop represents a collaboration between ISGlobal's Bioinformatics Research Group in Epidemiology (BRGE) and the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC).

## Background

### The Challenge

Health research in Africa faces unique challenges:

- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Sensitive health data requires robust protection while enabling collaborative research
- **Data Heterogeneity**: Different health systems use varied data formats and standards
- **Limited Infrastructure**: Need for solutions that work within existing technological constraints
- **Capacity Building**: Growing demand for local expertise in advanced data analytics

### Our Solution

This workshop addresses these challenges by introducing two complementary technologies:

::: {.callout-note}
## DataSHIELD
A pioneering approach that enables researchers to analyze data across multiple sites without physically sharing individual-level data. This preserves privacy while allowing powerful collaborative analyses.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## OMOP CDM
The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model standardizes the structure and content of health data, enabling consistent analyses across diverse data sources.

## Workshop Philosophy

Our approach is guided by several key principles:

### 1. **Practical Application**
Every concept taught is immediately applicable to real-world research scenarios relevant to African health contexts.

### 2. **Collaborative Learning**
Participants learn not just from instructors but from each other, sharing experiences and use cases.

### 3. **Sustainable Capacity**
We focus on building skills that participants can continue to develop and share within their institutions.

### 4. **Open Science**
All materials, code, and examples are openly available for continued learning and adaptation.

## Target Audience

This workshop is designed for:

- **Epidemiologists** working with multi-site health data
- **Data Scientists** interested in health applications
- **Biostatisticians** seeking privacy-preserving analytical methods
- **Health Informaticians** managing clinical or population health databases
- **Research Coordinators** overseeing collaborative studies
- **PhD Students** and **Postdocs** in health-related fields

### Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Basic knowledge of R programming
- Understanding of fundamental statistical concepts
- Experience with health data (clinical, epidemiological, or public health)
- Interest in collaborative and federated data analysis

## Learning Outcomes
