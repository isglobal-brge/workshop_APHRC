# DataSHIELD Workshop
**Secure Multi-Site Data Analysis Without Data Sharing**
:::

## Workshop Overview

DataSHIELD is a pioneering approach that enables researchers to analyze data across multiple sites without physically sharing individual-level data. This workshop will provide comprehensive training on implementing and using DataSHIELD for collaborative health research while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security.
