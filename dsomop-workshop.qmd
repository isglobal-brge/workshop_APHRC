# dsOMOP Workshop
**Federated Analysis of Standardized Health Data**
:::

## Workshop Overview

The dsOMOP workshop focuses on the integration of DataSHIELD with the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). This powerful combination enables federated analysis of standardized observational health data across multiple institutions while maintaining data privacy and security.
