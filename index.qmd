## About This Workshop

::: {.content-section}
Welcome to the DataSHIELD + OMOP CDM workshop, a comprehensive training program designed to empower researchers at the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) with cutting-edge tools for secure, collaborative health data analysis.

::: {.row .align-items-center .mt-4}
::: {.col-md-8}
This workshop combines two powerful technologies:

- **DataSHIELD**: A method that enables the analysis of sensitive research data without physically sharing the data itself
- **OMOP CDM**: A common data model that standardizes the structure and content of observational health data

Our goal is to provide APHRC researchers with the skills and knowledge to implement these technologies in their research, fostering collaboration while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and security.
